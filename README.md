# Complexity-Visualizer

A small python project as part of an assignment which allows you to run your choice of sorting algorithm and generate a CSV file with performance data (iterations -> inferred complexity) from these runs. The CSV is then plottable with the use of TKinter, pythons de facto GUI library!

Bundle the files in a directory and run main.py to test it out.
